## Introduction  
MBL549 Machine Learning in Architecture Course is instructed by Özgün Balaban.

Spring 2020

The course is an introduction to Machine Learning methods with examples from architectural design and creative coding. The course follows a hands on approach with many examples that will be developed during the course. The course includes topics from machine learning such as linear regression, unsupervised learning, supervised learning, reinforcement learning and finally neural networks.
